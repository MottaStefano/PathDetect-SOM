# PathDetect-SOM Tutorial: 

In this tutorial, you will learn how to analyize ligand binding molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the PathDetect-SOM tool.
In the SIMS folder you will find 15 replicas of steered MD simulations of a ligand unbinding from the Hypoxia inducible Factor-2α (HIF-2α) protein[^1] that are a small subset of the original data.
